	Gui themes can be defined in various ways.
	
	Without using any attributes an empty gui theme is defined. This is the way to completly
	define a gui theme from the ground up. You have to use this solution also if you import
	gui themes or create named fui themes. For an example of an imported gui theme see the
	layoutText.guitheme.xml file.
	
	The most often used solution is by using the 'extend' attribute as done here. This loads
	the specified gui theme first. Then the definitions in this file replace the definitions
	present in the extended gui theme.
	
	A less common solution is using the 'extendNamed' attribute. This locates the named
	gui theme with the matching selector from the attribute. If found a copy of the definition
	therein is applied to the gui theme before continue as with the extend attribute case.
	This solution allows to base named gui themes on other named gui themes previously
	defined in the current gui theme. This can be useful for more complex game UI situations
	to reduce the typing and maintenance overhead.
	
	The recommended solution is using modern.guitheme.xml as base with the 'extend' attribute.
	This provides a solid and working basis to apply your modifications.
