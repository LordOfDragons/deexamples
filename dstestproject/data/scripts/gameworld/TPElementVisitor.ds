 * project. The prefix TP is used to distinguish the extended element visitor from
 * the super class. Otherwise name conflicts can result.
 * 
 * ElementVisitor forwards visit calls to the visit call matching the parent class.
 * This allows writing generic visitors operating for example on a SimpleElement
 * if they do not need to know what extra features a subclass introduces.
