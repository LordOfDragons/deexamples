# Usage

Download or clone the source code to your computer. Each directory
contains an example project as well as a directory with some example
content you can use for getting to know the game engine. You can open
the test project right away to **Test-Run** them, examine the content
as well as making changes to see what happens.

In the Release section you can find pre-build **DELGA files** of all
the example projects so you can run them without installing the
**Drag[en]gine IGDE**.

# directory exampleApp

This project is a basic example of a game application. It contains
various small areas demonstrating individual engine features. Seeing
how something works is usually easier than reading documentation.

# directory dstestproject

Another test project focusing on various UI aspects of the
**DragonScript Script Module**. The exampe is organized as a set of
windows you can open each demonstrating UI features.

# directory audioTest

This project contains a flight of hallways with individual rooms
demonstrating the Drag[en]gine Audio System. This audio system provides
aurealization support which is enabled automatically if your **game objects**
are befitted with **audio models** and you use **audio texture properties**
on your **object skins**.

# directory videoplayer

This project contains a simple video player.

# directory network

This project contains an example of a network game application.
The project consist of a simple game prototype allowing a player
to host a game and others to join the game. Some basic game mechanics
are present which are unfinished on purpose. You are encouraged to
try complete the mechanics as a learning experience.

# directory degraphicstest

This project is a bit more than just an example project. The basic
idea behind this project is to allow **graphic module** developers
to test features using a simple test setup. This project allows to
load worlds and shows a configurable set of **parameters** on the UI.
The user can then manipulate the parameters to examine their effect.
The project is made in a way users/developers can share test worlds
with others.

# directory exampleContent

This directory contains some example content. Contains some simple
example skins covering a couple of different materials as well as
an example **game object class** defined using the **XML element class**
system. This content you can directly copy/paste into your projects
to experiment with.
